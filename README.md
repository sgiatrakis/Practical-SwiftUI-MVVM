# Practical-SwiftUI-MVVM

## About

A simple SwiftUI project demonstrating MVVM pattern by some practical examples.

## API used for demonstration

https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population

## Additional Logic

- Base subclassing logic (BaseView, BaseViewModel etc..)
- Networking Layer using Alamofire for the API Call
- Repository pattern that used to call Network and to serve back data to ViewModel
- Playing around with some @Binding or other SwiftUI & Combine features for adding some simple utilities like a Safety Check in a custom TextField
