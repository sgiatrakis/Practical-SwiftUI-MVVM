## API used for demonstration

## Additional Logic

- Base subclassing logic (BaseView, BaseViewModel etc..)
- Networking Layer using Alamofire for the API Call
- Repository pattern that used to call Network and to serve back data to ViewModel
- Playing around with some @Binding or other SwiftUI & Combine features for adding a few utilities like a Validation Check in a custom TextField
