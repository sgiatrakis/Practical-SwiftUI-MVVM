# Practical-SwiftUI-MVVM

## About

A simple SwiftUI project demonstrating MVVM pattern by some practical examples.

## Additional Logic

- Base subclassing logic (BaseView, BaseViewModel etc..)
- Networking Layer using Alamofire for the API Call
- Repository pattern that used to call Network and to serve back data to ViewModel
- Playing around with some @Binding or Combine features for adding some simple utilities like adding Safety Check in a custom TextField
